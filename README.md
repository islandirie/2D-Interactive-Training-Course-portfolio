Interactive Training Course
===
Built in Animate CC (aka *Flash*) :sweat_smile:
---

I built this interactive course while working as a media specialist in aviation. Originally helping with creating the design elements I was eventually tasked to focus on this project for a whole year (2016-2017). At the time, my only real experience in programming was 2 computer science classes and a slightly advanced class in algorithmic scripting in Java. This was a huge undertaking for me considering I didn't really know much and had to learn Actionscript 3.0. But after completing this project I learned a lot about the pains and joys of programming and lit my path into becoming a self-taught software engineer.

I'm mainly only showing all the .as files to serve as a portfolio or proof-of-work â‚¿. It would also be a good reference point for me if I ever want to go back into aviation. I wrote many functions for dealing with 2D animated aircraft components (on/off switches, rotation knobs, meter readings, etc.), practically built an unorganized library lol.

### Actionscript 3.0?
> while both TypeScript and JavaScript are similar to ActionScript 3, TypeScript's optional static typing makes it more similar to ActionScript 3 in terms of syntax and code structure. - **ChatGPT**

### Future updates:
* Displaying .swf files on modern browsers w/o flash player. Cool project called [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) that emulates flash player, its built with Rust, but unfortunately not compatible with as3.0...yet.
* All of the design elements are svg's, might explore animated svg's using html / css or js libraries like GSAP, threejs or D3.
* Maybe rebuild the cockpit animated switches as a js / typescript library.
